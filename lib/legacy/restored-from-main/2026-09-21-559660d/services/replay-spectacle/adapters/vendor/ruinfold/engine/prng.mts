// VENDORED — verbatim copy from @561-group/ruinfold-daily (apps/ruinfold/src/engine/prng.mts),
// commit tree as of 2026-08-19, for @red-cup-engineering/replay-spectacle's ruinfold adapter.
// This file is NOT maintained here: it is a snapshot of ruinfold's own game engine, copied
// (not reimplemented) so the renderer can independently recompute replay(seed, log) offline,
// without taking ruinfold-daily (a private, unpublished app) on as an installed dependency.
// Source of truth remains apps/ruinfold/src/engine/prng.mts — resync by re-copying, never hand-edit.
// Internal '#engine/*' imports below resolve via THIS package's own package.json "imports" map.

// prng — mulberry32, a tiny seeded PRNG. Zero deps, deterministic: same seed -> same stream,
// forever, on any machine. Per the design doc (ruinfold-daily-design.md §1.2) this is used
// ONLY by the dungeon generator (engine/dungeon.mts) to turn one seed into a whole daily's
// floor count / monster roster / loot table / hazard & relic placement. It must NEVER be
// imported by tick.mts, ai.mts, combat.mts, death.mts, or any other module that advances an
// already-built world — those are pure functions of trace state and the injected clock only.
// The engine as a whole never calls Math.random() or Date.now(): every source of "unknown until
// you look" is either this seeded generator (build-time) or a value carried in the move-log
// (run-time), so a replay is byte-identical to the original run.
