// VENDORED — verbatim copy from @red-cup-engineering/crucible-561-group (crucible-service/src/seed.mts),
// commit tree as of 2026-08-19, for @red-cup-engineering/replay-spectacle's crucible adapter.
// This file is NOT maintained here: it is a snapshot of crucible's own game engine, copied
// (not reimplemented) so the renderer can independently recompute replay(seed, moveLog) offline,
// without taking crucible-service (a private, unpublished app) on as an installed dependency.
// Source of truth remains crucible-service/src/seed.mts — resync by re-copying, never hand-edit.
// The one real external dependency this vendored code carries is @561-group/math (obstruction.mts
// imports '@561-group/math/obstruction/cochain' + '/settling'), a published, non-private, versioned
// library — installed normally as this package's own dependency, same as crucible-service does.

/**
 * `seed` — deterministic, reproducible randomness for crucible's daily tangles.
 *
 * Copied near-verbatim from onestone-service's and solitaire-service's `seed.mts` (the house
 * PRNG construction — see ANATOMY digest). Crucible's whole determinism promise ("same seed +
 * move log => identical final state and identical total cost, always") rests on this module:
 * every tangle is a pure function of a seed string, and nothing in `tangle.mts` or `engine.mts`
 * touches `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` — the only randomness anywhere in this codebase flows
 * through the `Rng` this file constructs.
