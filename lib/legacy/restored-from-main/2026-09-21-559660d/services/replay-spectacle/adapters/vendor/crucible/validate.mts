// VENDORED — verbatim copy from @red-cup-engineering/crucible-561-group (crucible-service/src/validate.mts),
// commit tree as of 2026-08-19, for @red-cup-engineering/replay-spectacle's crucible adapter.
// This file is NOT maintained here: it is a snapshot of crucible's own game engine, copied
// (not reimplemented) so the renderer can independently recompute replay(seed, moveLog) offline,
// without taking crucible-service (a private, unpublished app) on as an installed dependency.
// Source of truth remains crucible-service/src/validate.mts — resync by re-copying, never hand-edit.
// The one real external dependency this vendored code carries is @561-group/math (obstruction.mts
// imports '@561-group/math/obstruction/cochain' + '/settling'), a published, non-private, versioned
// library — installed normally as this package's own dependency, same as crucible-service does.

/**
 * `validate` — the executable solvability guarantee, in the onestone tradition: "a bare X
 * budget is not a Y proof." The generator (`tangle.mts#spawnTangle`) may never emit an
 * unwinnable daily — this module is what actually checks that, for real, on every seed it is
 * asked about, rather than asserting it once and hoping the generator never drifts.
 *
 * ## What is actually certified, stated precisely (no overclaim)
 *
 * `certifyTangle(seed)` proves that the tangle `spawnTangle(seed)` produces is settleable
 * *before any player move is made*, by constructing one concrete solving sequence and replaying
 * it through the real `engine.mts#applyMove` (real cost, real `isSettled` check — nothing here
 * is asserted, everything is computed). It does NOT claim every sequence of legal player moves
 * from the daily's start is settleable *within budget* — a careless player can always spend far
 * more than the certified minimal cost. See `README.md`'s honest-weaknesses section.
 *
 * It DOES, as of the `BondState` redesign in `types.mts` (playtest follow-up: MERGE and CATALYZE
 * were both found to be permanent, unrecoverable softlocks — see `engine.test.mts`'s "no
 * permanent softlock" property test for the executable proof this paragraph describes), imply
 * every reachable state stays *solvable*, just not necessarily cheaply: MERGE can only ever close
 * a cycle over the pinned spanning tree (pinned bonds are never removable, by any move, at any
 * cost), and CATALYZE can only ever lock down a currently-`exchangeable` bond — but forced SPLIT
 * remains legal, at real (often severe) transfinite cost, on every non-`pinned` bond regardless of
 * whether MERGE or CATALYZE previously locked it. Since the pinned bonds always form exactly a
 * spanning tree (acyclic, by construction), forced-splitting every single non-`pinned` bond in the
 * graph — however many merges and catalyzations preceded it — always leaves exactly the spanning
 * tree behind, which has spatial H¹ = 0 by definition. So the daily is never *truly* unwinnable
 * after any legal move sequence, only potentially far more expensive than it needed to be, which
 * is the whole point of the game.
 *
 * ## The certified solving sequence
 *
 * By construction (`tangle.mts`'s module doc), a freshly spawned tangle is a spanning tree of
 * `pinned` bonds plus exactly `spatialH1Rank` extra `exchangeable` bonds ("chords"), each of
 * which closes exactly one independent cycle over the tree. Clean-SPLITting the chords in any
 * order removes them one at a time without ever disconnecting the graph (the spanning tree keeps
 * everything connected throughout) — so the tangle's spatial H¹ decreases by exactly 1 per
 * split, reaching 0 after removing all the chords. That is the whole solving sequence: no search,
 * no heuristic, a direct consequence of the generator's own construction — and it is replayed
 * for real, not just reasoned about, by every test in `validate.test.mts`.
