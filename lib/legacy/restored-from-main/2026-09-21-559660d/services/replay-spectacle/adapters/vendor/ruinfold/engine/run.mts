// VENDORED — verbatim copy from @561-group/ruinfold-daily (apps/ruinfold/src/engine/run.mts),
// commit tree as of 2026-08-19, for @red-cup-engineering/replay-spectacle's ruinfold adapter.
// This file is NOT maintained here: it is a snapshot of ruinfold's own game engine, copied
// (not reimplemented) so the renderer can independently recompute replay(seed, log) offline,
// without taking ruinfold-daily (a private, unpublished app) on as an installed dependency.
// Source of truth remains apps/ruinfold/src/engine/run.mts — resync by re-copying, never hand-edit.
// Internal '#engine/*' imports below resolve via THIS package's own package.json "imports" map.

// run — the run state machine and the replay contract (design §2). A run is exactly "the seed
// plus the ordered intent log" — nothing else is trusted from the client. replay() is the ONLY
// function that turns a submitted log into a score: rebuild the canonical daily fresh from the
// seed, replay tick-by-tick, stop at the first terminal condition. Tolerance policy: NONE.
// Structural violations (malformed shape, wrong actor, broken tick/seq ordering, exceeding the
// tick cap) reject the WHOLE log, no score, no partial credit. In-fiction failures (a swing that
// missed, a portal that wasn't there) are not divergence — the engine already no-ops them, which
// is the same "impossible moves just don't do anything" behaviour any turn-based roguelike has.
