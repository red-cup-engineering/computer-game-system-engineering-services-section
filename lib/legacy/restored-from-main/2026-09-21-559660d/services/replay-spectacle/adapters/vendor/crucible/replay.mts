// VENDORED — verbatim copy from @red-cup-engineering/crucible-561-group (crucible-service/src/replay.mts),
// commit tree as of 2026-08-19, for @red-cup-engineering/replay-spectacle's crucible adapter.
// This file is NOT maintained here: it is a snapshot of crucible's own game engine, copied
// (not reimplemented) so the renderer can independently recompute replay(seed, moveLog) offline,
// without taking crucible-service (a private, unpublished app) on as an installed dependency.
// Source of truth remains crucible-service/src/replay.mts — resync by re-copying, never hand-edit.
// The one real external dependency this vendored code carries is @561-group/math (obstruction.mts
// imports '@561-group/math/obstruction/cochain' + '/settling'), a published, non-private, versioned
// library — installed normally as this package's own dependency, same as crucible-service does.

/**
 * `replay` — THE trust anchor (ANATOMY digest, solitaire-service's `replay`/`replayTo` shape).
 *
 * `replay(seed, moveLog)` is built by folding `engine.mts#applyMove` over a fresh
 * `spawnCertifiedTangle(seed)`. That is the entire mechanism behind "same seed + move log =>
 * identical final state and identical total cost, always": nothing in the fold reads a clock or
 * `Math.random()`, so the same two inputs always produce the same `RunState`, in this process or
 * any other.
 *
 * This is also the shape a future server-side leaderboard verifier calls once at submission time
 * (README.md): given a claimed `{ seed, moveLog, totalCost }`, the verifier recomputes
 * `replay(seed, moveLog).totalCost` and compares — replay IS the anti-cheat mechanism, not a
 * separate one. `replayTo` (a prefix of the log) is what `undo`/`redo` reduce to: different
 * cursors into the same fold, never separate code paths.
