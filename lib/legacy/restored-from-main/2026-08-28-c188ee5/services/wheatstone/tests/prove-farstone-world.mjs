// prove-farstone-world — the REST/JSON carrier, proven two ways:
//  (1) the carrier itself: connect + drain against a scripted fake Farstone HTTP server serving a
//      RECORDED session fixture (tests/fixtures/farstone-session.mjs), asserting the exact onLine
//      sequence and the exact POST /command body sent.
//  (2) a DETERMINISTIC RENDER test: the same fixture driven through the real Wheatstone app + arnold
//      Buffer (a mock Screen, no real terminal), asserting the exact rendered lines at each step —
//      no live network, no real elapsed wall-clock ticks (pollMs:0, draining is driven by hand via
//      the carrier's exposed `_poll()`), so the same fixture always renders to the same frame.
