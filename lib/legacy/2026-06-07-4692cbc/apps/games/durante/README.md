# @561-group/durante

```sh
npm test                    # 62 assertions across 4 proofs (arena, demon, combat, game)
npm run demo                # walk-and-shoot over kitty/sixel (or an ASCII downsample in a pipe)

## The three twists — THE LAW, played as mechanics

durante does not decorate a normal shooter with paraconsistent flavor. Each of its three core systems
**is** a reading of the bilattice the substrate holds — ⊤ is a designed mechanic here, never a debug dump.

### 1. The arena is a MERGE OF TRACES (`arena`)

A deathmatch level is not authored once. It **settles from the federated union ∥** of every player's
wall-trace (abrash's world is already the fold of an append-only trace). Two peers who lay the **same**
wall agree — it settles **t**. Two peers who **disagree** — alpha builds a wall, beta carves it open —
leave that cell **⊤**: a **contested wall** that **shivers** (abrash's pixel readout) AND is a **PHASE
GATE** you can walk through, precisely because nobody agrees it is solid (`passContested`). The merge is
order-independent (a G-Set union — no coordinator, no last-write-wins), and the contested walls are an
enumerable **value** (`contestedWalls(world)`), never an error.

### 2. The enemy is HELD ⊤ (`demon`)

A demon's **vitality is the FOLD** of its `alive` cell. Its spawn **affirms** `alive`; each wound
**denies** it. So between first blood and the kill the demon is **alive-AND-dead** — a held
contradiction **⊤**, the monster you cannot trust, still hunting but failing. It **settles to f (dead)**
only when the deny-evidence reaches the demon's `toughness`. **The kill is a SETTLE, not a subtraction**:

```
spawn            → t   (alive, hunting)
wound  (1/3)     → ⊤   (WOUNDED — alive AND denied, HELD, still hunts)
wound  (2/3)     → ⊤   (still held — every wound a witness kept, evidence linear)
wound  (3/3)     → f   (DEAD — the contradiction settled; the demon falls)
```

### 3. A weapon's effect is EVIDENCE you fold (`combat`)

The gun is **hitscan** — one ray down the crosshair. A landing shot does **not** subtract a hit-point; it
**appends `deny(demon, 'alive')`** — negative evidence on the demon's vitality. A wall **occludes** the
shot (the bullet stops at the nearer wall). You cannot wound a corpse. Every shot that lands is a witness
the LAW keeps **linearly** — no wound overwrites another; the demon's state is the fold of them all.

## The tick loop (`game`)

One turn, with **no global clock** (abrash's aperiodic settling): read the arena into a grid, resolve the
player's **move** against it (contested walls phase-walkable), resolve **fire** into wound evidence
(append-only), run each demon's **chase** (a functional position update; a demon at melee range
**CONTESTS the player's tile** to ⊤ — a held grasp, a shivering wall on top of you, counted as `hurt`),
re-grid, and **project** a 3D frame. `tick(state, intent)` returns a NEW state — append-only, never
mutated in place, replay-identical.

## The demo

`bin/durante.mjs` loads `world/blood-merge.jsonl` — the **merge of two peers' traces** (alpha built an
inner wall, beta carved it, so `voxel:4,4` is a contested ⊤ phase-gate) plus two demons. The headless run
aims at demon 0 and empties the magazine, printing each 3D frame as a small ASCII downsample and the
demon's vitality settling **t → ⊤ → f**: alive, then held alive-AND-dead while wounded, then dead once
the wound-evidence reaches toughness. The `%` columns are the contested gate, shivering. A calm status
line carries the four-value audit (`hunting`, `⊤ wounded`, `dead`, `⊤ walls`, `hurt`) — calm by default,
the ⊤ counts the headline.

## Built on

`@561-group/abrash` (the software-3D engine: federated voxel world, raycaster, grid collision, tick loop)
and `@561-group/computer` (the EAVT substrate + federation underneath abrash). The interactive cockpit
reaches abrash's pixel terminal (`@561-group/daleske`) **through the engine** — lazily, only in TTY mode —
so the engine, the tests, and the headless audit stay pure (abrash + computer only).
