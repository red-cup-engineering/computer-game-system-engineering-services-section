/**
 * Pipe-transport: serve the web by transporting what pipes out of our scripts.
 *
 * Weirdly ancient: a script is a filter — argv/params in, a representation out on
 * stdout. That is CGI, inetd, the Unix pipe. The program IS the endpoint.
 *
 * Super modern: the web layer (`@emsenn/web`) does not buffer that output into an
 * "API response object"; its `send()` pipes a byte stream — `AsyncIterable<Uint8Array>`
 * — straight to the HTTP response, chunk by chunk. So a script's pipe becomes an
 * HTTP body with no materialization: streaming all the way down.
 *
 * This module is the whole transport. A `Script` is `params -> pipe of bytes`;
 * `transportApp` turns a table of named scripts into an `@emsenn/web` `App` where
 * each route streams its script's output. `pipe` runs an actual child process and
 * yields its stdout — the literal "stuff that pipes out". A `Script` can equally be
 * an in-process async generator; both are just byte streams to the transport.
 *
 * The world logic lives in the packages (`@emsenn/fizzos`, and below it
 * computing/games/relationality). The site is only transport.
