/**
 * world-load — turn the engine-neutral `world/harbor.json` bible into a live FizzOS
 * world plus the descriptive `content` the engine does not carry.
 *
 * The split is deliberate and is the whole architecture in miniature:
 *
 *   - the **world** is a `@emsenn/fizzos` settled charge valuation: who/what is
 *     `located-in` where, and which room exits to which. That is the part with
 *     mechanics — perception, conservation, the tick — so it lives in the engine.
 *   - **content** is prose: the names, descriptions, exit *directions*, and tags
 *     that the engine has no opinion about. The command loop reads it to render.
 *
 * Loading is pure: `loadHarbor(bible)` returns `{ world, content }` and mutates
 * nothing. Every place/containment relation in the bible becomes a `located-in`
 * fact; every room exit becomes an `exit` fact (with the human direction kept in
 * `content`); the player is dropped in at `meta.playerStart`.
